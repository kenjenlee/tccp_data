# Data Portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio of projects related to data analytics and data engineering that I've done.

## Data Analytics Projects
Each project is contained in its own subfolder, with a README that describes more details:

- [NYC Citi Bike Trips](./NYC%20Citi%20Bike%20Trips/README.md) (Tools used: SQL, Google BigQuery, Google Colab, Python (Folium, pandas), Metabase (a BI visualization tool))
- [Terms of Credit Card Plan (TCCP)](./Terms%20of%20Credit%20Card%20Plan%20(TCCP)/TCCP_analysis.pdf) (Tools used: R, SQL, Google Colab)

## Data Engineering Projects
Due to the heavier setup required for these projects, they are available in their separate repositories.

- [Medallion Dashboard](https://github.com/kenjenlee/medallion_dashboard) (Tools used: Python (pandas, great expectations, prefect), Databricks, SQL)
- [Mock Products Pipeline](https://github.com/kenjenlee/mock_products_pipeline) (Tools used: PyAirbyte, BigQuery, pandera, pandas, minIO, dagster)

## Others
I have also done in-depth quantitative and qualitative analysis as a graduate researcher. For more details, please visit my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Cgcv5q8AAAAJ&hl=en).
