This repo contains data analysis projects done using tools like R, Python, SQL and Metabase (a Tableau/Power BI    alternative). Each project is contained in its own subfolder, with a README that describes more details:

- [NYC Citi Bike Trips](./NYC%20Citi%20Bike%20Trips/README.md)
- [Terms of Credit Card Plan (TCCP)](./Terms%20of%20Credit%20Card%20Plan%20(TCCP)/README.md)

I have also done in-depth quantitative and qualitative analysis as a graduate researcher. For more details, please visit my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Cgcv5q8AAAAJ&hl=en).
